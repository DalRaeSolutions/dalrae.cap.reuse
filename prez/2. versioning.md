# Versioning

- We used `npm pack`, but you can also use private NPM.JS or host your own
- Creating packages uses `package.json`, deployments use `mta.yml`. 
- Updating versions through `npm pack` is not enforced
- Multiple apps can use different versions of the same base
- Changes to an imported service are immediate on deploying a new version of the external service
